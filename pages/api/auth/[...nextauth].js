CS5356 TODO 1b. Authentication

Add sign in to your app by setting up NextAuth.

Define a CredentialsProvider with a username, and authorize the user
when they sign in by creating a user token that sets the user name
to be the provided username.

Note - For our prototype authentication system, we only need the username
and no password is required from the user.

See here for an example - https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials#example---username--password
