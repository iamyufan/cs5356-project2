        Create a component to represent a Question which should display
        the question text, the optional name of the person who 
        submitted the question, and the date & time when the question
        was submitted.

        This component should also allow an Instructor to delete a
        question, but an anonymous user shouldn't be able to. You can
        delete a question by making a DELETE /api/class-codes/[classCode]/question
        with the questionId
       */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Question;
